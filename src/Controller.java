/**
 * Controller is the class
 * that handles click events for the {@link View}.
 * <p>
 * Controller implements {@link MouseListener}.
 * Therefore, Controller implements a bunch methods of to handle
 * mouse clicks. You can see this at the bottom the class definition.
 * Most of these do nothing. {@link Controller#mousePressed(MouseEvent)} is
 * the only method that does something interesting.
 * <p>
 * When the {@link javax.swing.JFrame} create in
 * in the {@link View} is "clicked", the {@link Controller#mousePressed(MouseEvent)}
 * method is automatically called.
 * <p>
 * Based on mouse clicks, the Controller will update the
 * {@link Model} as needed.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Depends on:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Model}
 * <li>{@link View}
 * </ul>
